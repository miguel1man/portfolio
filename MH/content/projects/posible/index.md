## Final Project for Platzi and Ethereum Foundation
- ["Ethereum Developer Program" by Platzi](https://platzi.com/blog/inicia-el-ethereum-developer-program-en-platzi/)

## Project Objective

After the pandemic, many students no longer have access to technical and higher education due to a lack of funds. Many students struggle to pay for their studies and do not have access to loans or scholarships. This can limit their opportunities and potential for success in their careers. PoSÍble is an educational crowdfunding platform that seeks to resolve this problem.

## Proposed Solution

Posíble uses smart contracts to ensure transparency and reliability in the management of donated funds. Donors can choose which students they wish to support and follow the progress of their studies through the platform. By providing a way to obtain funds for education, PoSÍble helps to ensure that students have the opportunities and support they need to succeed in their careers.
