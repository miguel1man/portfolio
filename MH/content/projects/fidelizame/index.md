## Winning Hackathon Project
- [Latam WebX Hackathon](https://www.andinodao.org/hackathon)
- [Winner Announcement](https://twitter.com/andinodao/status/1586847043326132224)

## Project Objective
Large companies often struggle to understand their customers' behavior and offer a personalized experience. Fidelizame is an app that uses blockchain technology to solve this problem.

## Proposed Solution
By collecting and analyzing consumer behavior information, companies can better understand their customers and tailor their products and services to their needs and desires. Additionally, the blockchain technology provides an additional layer of security and privacy for consumer data. Users can accumulate ERC-20 tokens as they use the app and redeem them for rewards or discounts on products and services from companies.
