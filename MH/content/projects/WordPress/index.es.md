## Method of work
I started by talking to clients to define their needs and define the scope. Then, I coordinated with the UI/UX designers to create a design that met the client's requirements. After that, I developed the websites with WordPress, Elementor Pro, and widgets using HTML, CSS, and JS. The pages are optimized for desktop and mobile. Finally, I provided training to the client so they could effectively manage their website.
