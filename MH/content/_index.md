I'm Miguel Angel, a full-stack developer.

I love creating interfaces and find it amazing when code transforms from an idea into a tangible, functional product. As a technology enthusiast, I am always seeking opportunities to learn and collaborate with other professionals in meetups and hackathons.

Prior to the pandemic, I worked in civil construction. Today, through self-study, I have gained expertise in programming and am now proficient in building apps and automations.
