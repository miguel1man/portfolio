I'm Miguel Angel, a full-stack developer with a passion for creating interfaces. 

The transformation of code from idea to functional product never ceases to amaze me. As a technology enthusiast, I am constantly on the lookout for chances to learn and work with other professionals in meetups and hackathons.

Prior to the pandemic, I worked in civil construction, but through self-study I have gained expertise in my programming skills and am now well-versed in app and automation development.
